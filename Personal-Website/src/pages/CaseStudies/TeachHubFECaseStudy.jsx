                Peace Tech is a platform connecting students across cultures for meaningful service exchanges and collaborative skill-sharing. It's designed to foster understanding and engagement, encouraging users to teach and learn in a virtual setting. The project was developed by a team of frontend development students focusing on responsiveness and real-world functionality, built using React and Firebase for a seamless and interactive experience across devices.

              <p className="th-fe-section-text">
                Students often lack access to diverse knowledge sources and mentors. "Teach Hub" (referred to as Peace Tech in the overview) aims to solve this by enabling students to be both learners and teachers, reducing dependency on traditional educational hierarchies, and empowering self-learning. It fosters cross-cultural connections, building mutual respect and global awareness. It also addresses the limitation of cross-cultural communication due to language, geography, or access to collaboration platforms.
